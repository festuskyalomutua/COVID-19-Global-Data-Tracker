🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

📌 Project Overview

The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a data analysis and visualization project that explores worldwide COVID-19 trends using the Our World in Data dataset. It tracks cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time periods, turning raw data into clear insights and visuals.

🎯 Objectives

Import and clean the COVID-19 dataset

Analyze and visualize cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time

Compare metrics across countries & regions

Build interactive Choropleth maps for global insights

Present findings with visuals and narrative explanations

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

🐍 Python

📊 Pandas → Data cleaning & manipulation

📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization

🌍 Plotly Express → Interactive world maps

📓 Jupyter / Google Colab → Notebook environment

📊 Features & Insights

📈 Trends Over Time → Line charts for cases & deaths by country

🏥 Global Comparisons → Top countries ranked by total cases and deaths

💉 Vaccination Progress → Cumulative & % population vaccinated

🌍 Choropleth Maps → Interactive global visualizations

📑 Insights Report → Written explanations with each chart

🚀 How to Use

Download the dataset: Our World in Data COVID-19

Save it as owid-covid-data.csv

Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter

Upload the dataset and run all cells

Explore charts, maps, and insights

📝 Example Outputs

Line Chart → COVID-19 cases over time (Kenya, USA, India)

Bar Chart → Top 10 countries by total cases

Heatmap → Correlation of cases, deaths, vaccinations

Choropleth Map → Global cases & vaccination coverage

🔍 Key Insights

Vaccination rollouts strongly influenced case fatality rates

Unequal vaccine access created regional disparities

Case spikes aligned with low vaccination coverage

Maps highlighted global spread & vaccine gaps

📌 Future Work
